There were a lot of challenges faced with this project, becuase the work was very tedious with the changes. I spent a while with exacting colors, font size, and font format. Chat Gpt helped with some of those challenges, but overall I beleive there were easier way I could've used to update the html code with the css code. A huge challenge I faced was making the rows different colors on the species table. Also, correcting the format of the quiz section.
